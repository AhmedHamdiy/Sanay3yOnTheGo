A service network that allows users to order technician services. 

This was our web application project built for our database management systems course. We built it using the PERN stack.

There are three classes of users: customers, technicians and admins. The customers can order the services they want from technicians who are based in the same area, they can write reviews about their orders and make complaints to receive support. 

The technicians accept service orders, they can also offer discounts on their work and highlight some of their previous work to show up on their profile to customers. 

Admins are responsible for overseeing complaints, and considering feedbacks that come from customers & techs.
